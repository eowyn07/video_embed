## Project Description and Reflection

[Briefly describe your project using the prompts below.]

My main motivation is to create a machine that functional and easy to understand for all age groups. The main source of inspiration of the design of my machine is how morse code works in real situations. Morse code is transmitted and displayed through auditory and visual cues. For example, high pitched audios and light signals. The expected outcomes are the machine succesfully decodes messages with both input methods. It should also succesfully use the BBC micro:bits radio communication.

## File and Code Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

> `creative_morse.py`: main script that contains all functions. <br>

## Instruction to Use

[Provide clear steps on how to run or interact with your project and highlight key functions relevant to that function.]

1. `morsecode_test` helps to turn a plain text into morse codes.
2. have 2 micro:bits and flash code the python code onto both micro:bits
3. ensure that both micro:bits so that they can communicate with eachother
4. Use button A to interact with machine. Hold the button for more than 3 seconds to input a dash and less than 3 seconds for a dot.
5. If you would like to use light inputs use a flashlight to reach the threshold. Shine the light for more than 3 seconds to input a dash and less than 3 seconds for a dot.
6. Press B to stop the machine receiving inputs

## Artifact Demo
